# Predicting Sydney Trains Arrival Time using LSTM

A deep learning project to accurately predict train arrival times for Sydney Trains using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.

## Overview

This project successfully predicts train arrival times with a deviation of less than 2 minutes by processing and analyzing over 40,000 data points.

## Key Features

- Data collection and preprocessing of 40,000+ train records
- Feature engineering, selection, encoding, and normalization
- LSTM neural network implementation
- Model evaluation and optimization

## Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Results

The model achieves predictions with less than 2-minute deviation from actual arrival times.

## Project Structure

- `helper.py`: Utility functions for data processing
- `helperfunction/`: Additional helper modules
- `Jupyter/`: Notebooks for analysis and model development

## Getting Started
